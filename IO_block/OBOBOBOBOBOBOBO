       ffccnnttll() performs one of the operations described below on the open file descriptor _f_d.  The operation is determined by _c_m_d.

       ffccnnttll()  can take an optional third argument.  Whether or not this argument is required is determined by _c_m_d.  The required argument
       type is indicated in parentheses after each _c_m_d name (in most cases, the required type is _i_n_t, and we identify  the  argument  using
       the name _a_r_g), or _v_o_i_d is specified if the argument is not required.

       Certain  of  the  operations  below  are  supported  only since a particular Linux kernel version.  The preferred method of checking
       whether the host kernel supports a particular operation is to invoke ffccnnttll() with the desired _c_m_d value and then  test  whether  the
       call failed with EEIINNVVAALL, indicating that the kernel does not recognize this value.

              Find the lowest numbered available file descriptor greater than or equal to _a_r_g and make it be a copy of _f_d.  This is differ‐
              ent from dduupp22(2), which uses exactly the descriptor specified.

              On success, the new descriptor is returned.

              program  to avoid an additional ffccnnttll() FF__SSEETTFFDD operation to set the FFDD__CCLLOOEEXXEECC flag.  For an explanation of why this flag is
              useful, see the description of OO__CCLLOOEEXXEECC in ooppeenn(2).

       The following commands manipulate the flags associated  with  a  file  descriptor.   Currently,  only  one  such  flag  is  defined:
       FFDD__CCLLOOEEXXEECC, the close-on-exec flag.  If the FFDD__CCLLOOEEXXEECC bit is 0, the file descriptor will remain open across an eexxeeccvvee(2), otherwise
       it will be closed.

       FF__GGEETTFFDD (_v_o_i_d)

              Set the file descriptor flags to the value specified by _a_r_g.

       In multithreaded programs, using ffccnnttll() FF__SSEETTFFDD to set the close-on-exec flag at the same time as another thread performs a ffoorrkk(2)
       plus  eexxeeccvvee(2)  is  vulnerable to a race condition that may unintentionally leak the file descriptor to the program executed in the
       child process.  See the discussion of the OO__CCLLOOEEXXEECC flag in ooppeenn(2) for details and a remedy to the problem.

   FFiillee ssttaattuuss ffllaaggss
       Each open file description has certain associated status flags, initialized by ooppeenn(2) and possibly modified by ffccnnttll().  Duplicated
       file  descriptors (made with dduupp(2), ffccnnttll(F_DUPFD), ffoorrkk(2), etc.) refer to the same open file description, and thus share the same
       file status flags.

       The file status flags and their semantics are described in ooppeenn(2).

       FF__GGEETTFFLL (_v_o_i_d)

       FF__SSEETTFFLL (_i_n_t)
              Set the file status flags to the value specified by _a_r_g.  File access mode (OO__RRDDOONNLLYY, OO__WWRROONNLLYY,  OO__RRDDWWRR)  and  file  creation

   AAddvviissoorryy rreeccoorrdd lloocckkiinngg
       Linux  implements  traditional ("process-associated") UNIX record locks, as standardized by POSIX.  For a Linux-specific alternative
       with better semantics, see the discussion of open file description locks below.

       FF__SSEETTLLKK, FF__SSEETTLLKKWW, and FF__GGEETTLLKK are used to acquire, release, and test for the existence of record locks (also known  as  byte-range,
       file-segment,  or  file-region locks).  The third argument, _l_o_c_k, is a pointer to a structure that has at least the following fields
       (in unspecified order).

           struct flock {
               ...
               short l_type;    /* Type of lock: F_RDLCK,
                                   F_WRLCK, F_UNLCK */
               short l_whence;  /* How to interpret l_start:
                                   SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END */
               off_t l_start;   /* Starting offset for lock */
               off_t l_len;     /* Number of bytes to lock */
               pid_t l_pid;     /* PID of process blocking our lock
                                   (set by F_GETLK and F_OFD_GETLK) */
               ...
           };

       The _l___w_h_e_n_c_e, _l___s_t_a_r_t, and _l___l_e_n fields of this structure specify the range of bytes we wish to lock.  Bytes past  the  end  of  the
       file may be locked, but not bytes before the start of the file.

       _l___s_t_a_r_t is the starting offset for the lock, and is interpreted relative to either: the start of the file (if _l___w_h_e_n_c_e is SSEEEEKK__SSEETT);
       the current file offset (if _l___w_h_e_n_c_e is SSEEEEKK__CCUURR); or the end of the file (if _l___w_h_e_n_c_e  is  SSEEEEKK__EENNDD).   In  the  final  two  cases,
       _l___s_t_a_r_t can be a negative number provided the offset does not lie before the start of the file.

       _l___l_e_n  specifies the number of bytes to be locked.  If _l___l_e_n is positive, then the range to be locked covers bytes _l___s_t_a_r_t up to and
       including _l___s_t_a_r_t+_l___l_e_n-1.  Specifying 0 for _l___l_e_n has the special meaning: lock all bytes starting at  the  location  specified  by
       _l___w_h_e_n_c_e and _l___s_t_a_r_t through to the end of file, no matter how large the file grows.

       POSIX.1-2001  allows  (but does not require) an implementation to support a negative _l___l_e_n value; if _l___l_e_n is negative, the interval
       described by _l_o_c_k covers bytes _l___s_t_a_r_t+_l___l_e_n up to and including _l___s_t_a_r_t-1.  This is supported by Linux since kernel versions 2.4.21
       and 2.5.49.

       The _l___t_y_p_e field can be used to place a read (FF__RRDDLLCCKK) or a write (FF__WWRRLLCCKK) lock on a file.  Any number of processes may hold a read
       lock (shared lock) on a file region, but only one process may hold a write lock (exclusive lock).  An exclusive  lock  excludes  all
       other  locks, both shared and exclusive.  A single process can hold only one type of lock on a file region; if a new lock is applied
       to an already-locked region, then the existing lock is converted to the new lock type.  (Such  conversions  may  involve  splitting,
       shrinking,  or  coalescing  with  an  existing lock if the byte range specified by the new lock does not precisely coincide with the
       range of the existing lock.)

       FF__SSEETTLLKK (_s_t_r_u_c_t _f_l_o_c_k _*)
              Acquire a lock (when _l___t_y_p_e is FF__RRDDLLCCKK or FF__WWRRLLCCKK) or release a lock (when _l___t_y_p_e is FF__UUNNLLCCKK) on the bytes specified  by  the
              _l___w_h_e_n_c_e, _l___s_t_a_r_t, and _l___l_e_n fields of _l_o_c_k.  If a conflicting lock is held by another process, this call returns -1 and sets
              _e_r_r_n_o to EEAACCCCEESS or EEAAGGAAIINN.  (The error returned in this case differs across implementations, so  POSIX  requires  a  portable
              application to check for both errors.)

       FF__SSEETTLLKKWW (_s_t_r_u_c_t _f_l_o_c_k _*)
              As for FF__SSEETTLLKK, but if a conflicting lock is held on the file, then wait for that lock to be released.  If a signal is caught
              while waiting, then the call is interrupted and (after the signal handler has  returned)  returns  immediately  (with  return
              value -1 and _e_r_r_n_o set to EEIINNTTRR; see ssiiggnnaall(7)).

       FF__GGEETTLLKK (_s_t_r_u_c_t _f_l_o_c_k _*)
              On  input  to this call, _l_o_c_k describes a lock we would like to place on the file.  If the lock could be placed, ffccnnttll() does
              not actually place it, but returns FF__UUNNLLCCKK in the _l___t_y_p_e field  of  _l_o_c_k  and  leaves  the  other  fields  of  the  structure
              unchanged.

              If one or more incompatible locks would prevent this lock being placed, then ffccnnttll() returns details about one of those locks
              in the _l___t_y_p_e, _l___w_h_e_n_c_e, _l___s_t_a_r_t, and _l___l_e_n fields of _l_o_c_k.  If the conflicting lock is  a  traditional  (process-associated)
              record  lock,  then  the  _l___p_i_d field is set to the PID of the process holding that lock.  If the conflicting lock is an open
              file description lock, then _l___p_i_d is set to -1.  Note that the returned information may already be out of date  by  the  time
              the caller inspects it.

       In  order to place a read lock, _f_d must be open for reading.  In order to place a write lock, _f_d must be open for writing.  To place
       both types of lock, open a file read-write.

       When placing locks with FF__SSEETTLLKKWW, the kernel detects _d_e_a_d_l_o_c_k_s, whereby two or more processes  have  their  lock  requests  mutually
       blocked  by locks held by the other processes.  For example, suppose process A holds a write lock on byte 100 of a file, and process
       B holds a write lock on byte 200.  If each process then attempts to lock  the  byte  already  locked  by  the  other  process  using
       FF__SSEETTLLKKWW,  then,  without  deadlock detection, both processes would remain blocked indefinitely.  When the kernel detects such dead‐
       locks, it causes one of the blocking lock requests to immediately fail with the error EEDDEEAADDLLKK; an application that  encounters  such
       an  error  should  release  some  of  its  locks  to  allow other applications to proceed before attempting regain the locks that it
       requires.  Circular deadlocks involving more than two processes are also detected.  Note, however, that there are limitations to the
       kernel's deadlock-detection algorithm; see BUGS.

       As well as being removed by an explicit FF__UUNNLLCCKK, record locks are automatically released when the process terminates.

       Record locks are not inherited by a child created via ffoorrkk(2), but are preserved across an eexxeeccvvee(2).

       Because  of  the  buffering  performed  by  the  ssttddiioo(3) library, the use of record locking with routines in that package should be
       avoided; use rreeaadd(2) and wwrriittee(2) instead.

       The record locks described above are associated with the process (unlike the open file description locks described below).  This has
       some unfortunate consequences:

       *  If  a  process closes _a_n_y file descriptor referring to a file, then all of the process's locks on that file are released, regard‐
          less of the file descriptor(s) on which the locks were obtained.  This is bad: it means that a process can lose its  locks  on  a
          file such as _/_e_t_c_/_p_a_s_s_w_d or _/_e_t_c_/_m_t_a_b when for some reason a library function decides to open, read, and close the same file.

       *  The  threads  in  a process share locks.  In other words, a multithreaded program can't use record locking to ensure that threads
          don't simultaneously access the same region of a file.

       Open file description locks solve both of these problems.

   OOppeenn ffiillee ddeessccrriippttiioonn lloocckkss ((nnoonn--PPOOSSIIXX))
       Open file description locks are advisory byte-range locks whose operation is in most respects identical to  the  traditional  record
       locks  described  above.   This  lock  type is Linux-specific, and available since Linux 3.15.  (There is a proposal with the Austin
       Group to include this lock type in the next revision of POSIX.1.)  For an explanation of open file descriptions, see ooppeenn(2).

       The principal difference between the two lock types is that whereas traditional record locks are associated  with  a  process,  open
       file  description  locks  are  associated  with  the open file description on which they are acquired, much like locks acquired with
       fflloocckk(2).  Consequently (and unlike traditional advisory record locks), open file description locks  are  inherited  across  ffoorrkk(2)
       (and  cclloonnee(2)  with  CCLLOONNEE__FFIILLEESS),  and  are only automatically released on the last close of the open file description, instead of
       being released on any close of the file.

       Conflicting lock combinations (i.e., a read lock and a write lock or two write locks) where one lock is  an  open  file  description
       lock  and  the other is a traditional record lock conflict even when they are acquired by the same process on the same file descrip‐
       tor.

       Open file description locks placed via the same open file description (i.e., via the same file descriptor, or via a duplicate of the
       file  descriptor  created  by  ffoorrkk(2),  dduupp(2),  ffccnnttll(2)  FF__DDUUPPFFDD, and so on) are always compatible: if a new lock is placed on an
       already locked region, then the existing lock is converted to the new lock type.  (Such conversions may result in splitting, shrink‐
       ing, or coalescing with an existing lock as discussed above.)

       On  the other hand, open file description locks may conflict with each other when they are acquired via different open file descrip‐
       tions.  Thus, the threads in a multithreaded program can use open file description locks to synchronize access to a file  region  by
       having each thread perform its own ooppeenn(2) on the file and applying locks via the resulting file descriptor.

       As  with traditional advisory locks, the third argument to ffccnnttll(), _l_o_c_k, is a pointer to an _f_l_o_c_k structure.  By contrast with tra‐
       ditional record locks, the _l___p_i_d field of that structure must be set to zero when using the commands described below.

       The commands for working with open file description locks are analogous to those used with traditional locks:

       FF__OOFFDD__SSEETTLLKK (_s_t_r_u_c_t _f_l_o_c_k _*)
              Acquire an open file description lock (when _l___t_y_p_e is FF__RRDDLLCCKK or FF__WWRRLLCCKK) or release an  open  file  description  lock  (when
              _l___t_y_p_e  is FF__UUNNLLCCKK) on the bytes specified by the _l___w_h_e_n_c_e, _l___s_t_a_r_t, and _l___l_e_n fields of _l_o_c_k.  If a conflicting lock is held
              by another process, this call returns -1 and sets _e_r_r_n_o to EEAAGGAAIINN.

       FF__OOFFDD__SSEETTLLKKWW (_s_t_r_u_c_t _f_l_o_c_k _*)
              As for FF__OOFFDD__SSEETTLLKK, but if a conflicting lock is held on the file, then wait for that lock to be released.  If  a  signal  is
              caught  while  waiting,  then  the  call is interrupted and (after the signal handler has returned) returns immediately (with
              return value -1 and _e_r_r_n_o set to EEIINNTTRR; see ssiiggnnaall(7)).

       FF__OOFFDD__GGEETTLLKK (_s_t_r_u_c_t _f_l_o_c_k _*)
              On input to this call, _l_o_c_k describes an open file description lock we would like to place on the file.  If the lock could be
              placed,  ffccnnttll()  does  not actually place it, but returns FF__UUNNLLCCKK in the _l___t_y_p_e field of _l_o_c_k and leaves the other fields of
              the structure unchanged.  If one or more incompatible locks would prevent this lock being placed, then details about  one  of
              these locks are returned via _l_o_c_k, as described above for FF__GGEETTLLKK.

       In  the  current  implementation, no deadlock detection is performed for open file description locks.  (This contrasts with process-
       associated record locks, for which the kernel does perform deadlock detection.)

       _W_a_r_n_i_n_g: the Linux implementation of mandatory locking is unreliable.  See BUGS below.

       By default, both traditional (process-associated) and open file description record locks  are  advisory.   Advisory  locks  are  not
       enforced and are useful only between cooperating processes.

       Both lock types can also be mandatory.  Mandatory locks are enforced for all processes.  If a process tries to perform an incompati‐
       ble access (e.g., rreeaadd(2) or wwrriittee(2)) on a file region that has an incompatible  mandatory  lock,  then  the  result  depends  upon
       whether  the  OO__NNOONNBBLLOOCCKK flag is enabled for its open file description.  If the OO__NNOONNBBLLOOCCKK flag is not enabled, then the system call
       is blocked until the lock is removed or converted to a mode that is compatible with the access.  If the OO__NNOONNBBLLOOCCKK flag is  enabled,
       then the system call fails with the error EEAAGGAAIINN.

       To make use of mandatory locks, mandatory locking must be enabled both on the filesystem that contains the file to be locked, and on
       the file itself.  Mandatory locking is enabled on a filesystem using the "-o mand" option to mmoouunntt(8), or the MMSS__MMAANNDDLLOOCCKK  flag  for
       mmoouunntt(2).   Mandatory  locking  is enabled on a file by disabling group execute permission on the file and enabling the set-group-ID
       permission bit (see cchhmmoodd(1) and cchhmmoodd(2)).

       Mandatory locking is not specified by POSIX.  Some other systems also support mandatory locking, although  the  details  of  how  to
       enable it vary across systems.

       FF__GGEETTOOWWNN, FF__SSEETTOOWWNN, FF__GGEETTOOWWNN__EEXX, FF__SSEETTOOWWNN__EEXX, FF__GGEETTSSIIGG and FF__SSEETTSSIIGG are used to manage I/O availability signals:

       FF__GGEETTOOWWNN (_v_o_i_d)
              Return  (as  the  function result) the process ID or process group currently receiving SSIIGGIIOO and SSIIGGUURRGG signals for events on
              file descriptor _f_d.  Process IDs are returned as positive values; process group IDs are returned as negative values (but  see
              BUGS below).  _a_r_g is ignored.

       FF__SSEETTOOWWNN (_i_n_t)
              Set  the process ID or process group ID that will receive SSIIGGIIOO and SSIIGGUURRGG signals for events on file descriptor _f_d to the ID
              given in _a_r_g.  A process ID is specified as a positive value; a process group ID is specified as a negative value.  Most com‐
              monly, the calling process specifies itself as the owner (that is, _a_r_g is specified as ggeettppiidd(2)).

              If you set the OO__AASSYYNNCC status flag on a file descriptor by using the FF__SSEETTFFLL command of ffccnnttll(), a SSIIGGIIOO signal is sent when‐
              ever input or output becomes possible on that file descriptor.  FF__SSEETTSSIIGG can be used to obtain delivery  of  a  signal  other
              than SSIIGGIIOO.  If this permission check fails, then the signal is silently discarded.

              Sending  a  signal  to  the  owner  process  (group)  specified  by FF__SSEETTOOWWNN is subject to the same permissions checks as are
              described for kkiillll(2), where the sending process is the one that employs FF__SSEETTOOWWNN (but see BUGS below).

              If the file descriptor _f_d refers to a socket, FF__SSEETTOOWWNN also selects the recipient of SSIIGGUURRGG signals that are  delivered  when
              out-of-band  data arrives on that socket.  (SSIIGGUURRGG is sent in any situation where sseelleecctt(2) would report the socket as having
              an "exceptional condition".)

              The following was true in 2.6.x kernels up to and including kernel 2.6.11:

                     If a nonzero value is given to FF__SSEETTSSIIGG in a multithreaded process running with  a  threading  library  that  supports
                     thread  groups  (e.g.,  NPTL),  then  a  positive  value given to FF__SSEETTOOWWNN has a different meaning: instead of being a
                     process ID identifying a whole process, it is a thread ID identifying a specific  thread  within  a  process.   Conse‐
                     quently,  it  may  be  necessary to pass FF__SSEETTOOWWNN the result of ggeettttiidd(2) instead of ggeettppiidd(2) to get sensible results
                     when FF__SSEETTSSIIGG is used.  (In current Linux threading implementations, a main thread's thread ID  is  the  same  as  its
                     process  ID.   This  means  that  a  single-threaded program can equally use ggeettttiidd(2) or ggeettppiidd(2) in this scenario.)
                     Note, however, that the statements in this paragraph do not apply to the SSIIGGUURRGG signal generated for out-of-band  data
                     on  a  socket:  this  signal  is  always  sent to either a process or a process group, depending on the value given to
                     FF__SSEETTOOWWNN.

              The above behavior was accidentally dropped in  Linux  2.6.12,  and  won't  be  restored.   From  Linux  2.6.32  onward,  use
              FF__SSEETTOOWWNN__EEXX to target SSIIGGIIOO and SSIIGGUURRGG signals at a particular thread.

       FF__GGEETTOOWWNN__EEXX (_s_t_r_u_c_t _f___o_w_n_e_r___e_x _*) (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Return  the  current  file  descriptor  owner  settings  as  defined by a previous FF__SSEETTOOWWNN__EEXX operation.  The information is
              returned in the structure pointed to by _a_r_g, which has the following form:

                  struct f_owner_ex {
                      int   type;
                      pid_t pid;
                  };

              The _t_y_p_e field will have one of the values FF__OOWWNNEERR__TTIIDD, FF__OOWWNNEERR__PPIIDD, or FF__OOWWNNEERR__PPGGRRPP.  The _p_i_d field is  a  positive  integer
              representing a thread ID, process ID, or process group ID.  See FF__SSEETTOOWWNN__EEXX for more details.

       FF__SSEETTOOWWNN__EEXX (_s_t_r_u_c_t _f___o_w_n_e_r___e_x _*) (since Linux 2.6.32)
              This  operation  performs  a similar task to FF__SSEETTOOWWNN.  It allows the caller to direct I/O availability signals to a specific
              thread, process, or process group.  The caller specifies the target of signals via _a_r_g, which is a pointer  to  a  _f___o_w_n_e_r___e_x
              structure.  The _t_y_p_e field has one of the following values, which define how _p_i_d is interpreted:

              FF__OOWWNNEERR__TTIIDD
                     Send  the signal to the thread whose thread ID (the value returned by a call to cclloonnee(2) or ggeettttiidd(2)) is specified in
                     _p_i_d.

              FF__OOWWNNEERR__PPIIDD
                     Send the signal to the process whose ID is specified in _p_i_d.

              FF__OOWWNNEERR__PPGGRRPP
                     Send the signal to the process group whose ID is specified in _p_i_d.  (Note that, unlike with FF__SSEETTOOWWNN, a process  group
                     ID is specified as a positive value here.)

       FF__GGEETTSSIIGG (_v_o_i_d)
              Return  (as the function result) the signal sent when input or output becomes possible.  A value of zero means SSIIGGIIOO is sent.
              Any other value (including SSIIGGIIOO) is the signal sent instead, and in this case additional info is  available  to  the  signal
              handler if installed with SSAA__SSIIGGIINNFFOO.  _a_r_g is ignored.

       FF__SSEETTSSIIGG (_i_n_t)
              Set  the  signal  sent  when  input  or output becomes possible to the value given in _a_r_g.  A value of zero means to send the
              default SSIIGGIIOO signal.  Any other value (including SSIIGGIIOO) is the signal to send instead, and in this case additional  info  is
              available to the signal handler if installed with SSAA__SSIIGGIINNFFOO.

              By  using  FF__SSEETTSSIIGG with a nonzero value, and setting SSAA__SSIIGGIINNFFOO for the signal handler (see ssiiggaaccttiioonn(2)), extra information
              about I/O events is passed to the handler in a _s_i_g_i_n_f_o___t structure.  If the _s_i___c_o_d_e field indicates the source  is  SSII__SSIIGGIIOO,
              the  _s_i___f_d  field gives the file descriptor associated with the event.  Otherwise, there is no indication which file descrip‐
              tors are pending, and you should use the usual mechanisms (sseelleecctt(2), ppoollll(2), rreeaadd(2) with OO__NNOONNBBLLOOCCKK set etc.) to determine
              which file descriptors are available for I/O.

              Note  that  the file descriptor provided in _s_i___f_d is the one that that was specified during the FF__SSEETTSSIIGG operation.  This can
              lead to an unusual corner case.  If the file descriptor is duplicated (dduupp(2) or similar), and the original  file  descriptor
              is  closed, then I/O events will continue to be generated, but the _s_i___f_d field will contain the number of the now closed file
              descriptor.

              By selecting a real time signal (value >= SSIIGGRRTTMMIINN), multiple I/O events may be queued using the same signal numbers.  (Queu‐
              ing is dependent on available memory.)  Extra information is available if SSAA__SSIIGGIINNFFOO is set for the signal handler, as above.

              Note that Linux imposes a limit on the number of real-time signals that may be queued to a process (see ggeettrrlliimmiitt(2) and ssiigg‐‐
              nnaall(7)) and if this limit is reached, then the kernel reverts to delivering SSIIGGIIOO, and this signal is delivered to the entire
              process rather than to a specific thread.

       Using these mechanisms, a program can implement fully asynchronous I/O without using sseelleecctt(2) or ppoollll(2) most of the time.

       The  use of OO__AASSYYNNCC is specific to BSD and Linux.  The only use of FF__GGEETTOOWWNN and FF__SSEETTOOWWNN specified in POSIX.1 is in conjunction with
       the use of the SSIIGGUURRGG signal on sockets.  (POSIX does not specify the SSIIGGIIOO signal.)  FF__GGEETTOOWWNN__EEXX, FF__SSEETTOOWWNN__EEXX, FF__GGEETTSSIIGG, and FF__SSEETT‐‐
       SSIIGG  are Linux-specific.  POSIX has asynchronous I/O and the _a_i_o___s_i_g_e_v_e_n_t structure to achieve similar things; these are also avail‐
       able in Linux as part of the GNU C Library (Glibc).

   LLeeaasseess
       FF__SSEETTLLEEAASSEE and FF__GGEETTLLEEAASSEE (Linux 2.4 onward) are used (respectively) to establish a new lease, and retrieve the  current  lease,  on
       the  open file description referred to by the file descriptor _f_d.  A file lease provides a mechanism whereby the process holding the
       lease (the "lease holder") is notified (via delivery of a signal) when a process (the "lease breaker") tries  to  ooppeenn(2)  or  ttrruunn‐‐
       ccaattee(2) the file referred to by that file descriptor.

       FF__SSEETTLLEEAASSEE (_i_n_t)
              Set or remove a file lease according to which of the following values is specified in the integer _a_r_g:

              FF__RRDDLLCCKK
                     Take  out  a read lease.  This will cause the calling process to be notified when the file is opened for writing or is
                     truncated.  A read lease can be placed only on a file descriptor that is opened read-only.

              FF__WWRRLLCCKK
                     Take out a write lease.  This will cause the caller to be notified when the file is opened for reading or  writing  or
                     is truncated.  A write lease may be placed on a file only if there are no other open file descriptors for the file.

              FF__UUNNLLCCKK
                     Remove our lease from the file.

       Leases  are  associated  with  an  open file description (see ooppeenn(2)).  This means that duplicate file descriptors (created by, for
       example, ffoorrkk(2) or dduupp(2)) refer to the same lease, and this lease may be modified or released  using  any  of  these  descriptors.
       Furthermore,  the  lease is released by either an explicit FF__UUNNLLCCKK operation on any of these duplicate descriptors, or when all such
       descriptors have been closed.

       Leases may be taken out only on regular files.  An unprivileged process may take out a lease  only  on  a  file  whose  UID  (owner)
       matches the filesystem UID of the process.  A process with the CCAAPP__LLEEAASSEE capability may take out leases on arbitrary files.

       FF__GGEETTLLEEAASSEE (_v_o_i_d)
              Indicates  what  type  of  lease  is associated with the file descriptor _f_d by returning either FF__RRDDLLCCKK, FF__WWRRLLCCKK, or FF__UUNNLLCCKK,
              indicating, respectively, a read lease , a write lease, or no lease.  _a_r_g is ignored.

       When a process (the "lease breaker") performs an ooppeenn(2) or ttrruunnccaattee(2) that conflicts with a lease established via FF__SSEETTLLEEAASSEE,  the
       system  call is blocked by the kernel and the kernel notifies the lease holder by sending it a signal (SSIIGGIIOO by default).  The lease
       holder should respond to receipt of this signal by doing whatever cleanup is required in preparation for the file to be accessed  by
       another  process (e.g., flushing cached buffers) and then either remove or downgrade its lease.  A lease is removed by performing an
       FF__SSEETTLLEEAASSEE command specifying _a_r_g as FF__UUNNLLCCKK.  If the lease holder currently holds a write lease on the file, and the lease  breaker
       is opening the file for reading, then it is sufficient for the lease holder to downgrade the lease to a read lease.  This is done by
       performing an FF__SSEETTLLEEAASSEE command specifying _a_r_g as FF__RRDDLLCCKK.

       If the lease holder fails to downgrade or remove the lease within the number of seconds specified in  _/_p_r_o_c_/_s_y_s_/_f_s_/_l_e_a_s_e_-_b_r_e_a_k_-_t_i_m_e,
       then the kernel forcibly removes or downgrades the lease holder's lease.

       Once  a lease break has been initiated, FF__GGEETTLLEEAASSEE returns the target lease type (either FF__RRDDLLCCKK or FF__UUNNLLCCKK, depending on what would
       be compatible with the lease breaker) until the lease holder voluntarily downgrades or removes the lease or the kernel forcibly does
       so after the lease break timer expires.

       Once  the  lease has been voluntarily or forcibly removed or downgraded, and assuming the lease breaker has not unblocked its system
       call, the kernel permits the lease breaker's system call to proceed.

       If the lease breaker's blocked ooppeenn(2) or ttrruunnccaattee(2) is interrupted by a signal handler, then the system call fails with the  error
       EEIINNTTRR,  but  the other steps still occur as described above.  If the lease breaker is killed by a signal while blocked in ooppeenn(2) or
       ttrruunnccaattee(2), then the other steps still occur as described above.  If the lease breaker specifies the OO__NNOONNBBLLOOCCKK flag  when  calling
       ooppeenn(2), then the call immediately fails with the error EEWWOOUULLDDBBLLOOCCKK, but the other steps still occur as described above.

       The  default  signal  used to notify the lease holder is SSIIGGIIOO, but this can be changed using the FF__SSEETTSSIIGG command to ffccnnttll().  If a
       FF__SSEETTSSIIGG command is performed (even one specifying SSIIGGIIOO), and the signal handler is established using SSAA__SSIIGGIINNFFOO, then the  handler
       will  receive  a  _s_i_g_i_n_f_o___t  structure  as its second argument, and the _s_i___f_d field of this argument will hold the descriptor of the
       leased file that has been accessed by another process.  (This is useful if the caller holds leases against multiple files.)

              (In order to obtain these definitions, the __GGNNUU__SSOOUURRCCEE feature test macro must be defined before including _a_n_y header files.)

              Directory notifications are normally "one-shot", and the  application  must  reregister  to  receive  further  notifications.
              Alternatively, if DDNN__MMUULLTTIISSHHOOTT is included in _a_r_g, then notification will remain in effect until explicitly removed.

              A  series  of  FF__NNOOTTIIFFYY  requests is cumulative, with the events in _a_r_g being added to the set already monitored.  To disable
              notification of all events, make an FF__NNOOTTIIFFYY call specifying _a_r_g as 0.

              Notification occurs via delivery of a signal.  The default signal is SSIIGGIIOO, but this can be changed using the  FF__SSEETTSSIIGG  com‐
              mand  to  ffccnnttll().   (Note  that  SSIIGGIIOO is one of the nonqueuing standard signals; switching to the use of a real-time signal
              means that multiple notifications can be queued to the process.)  In the latter case, the signal handler receives a _s_i_g_i_n_f_o___t
              structure as its second argument (if the handler was established using SSAA__SSIIGGIINNFFOO) and the _s_i___f_d field of this structure con‐
              tains the file descriptor which generated the notification (useful when establishing notification on multiple directories).

              Especially when using DDNN__MMUULLTTIISSHHOOTT, a real time signal should be used for notification, so that multiple notifications can be
              queued.

              NNOOTTEE::  New  applications  should  use  the  _i_n_o_t_i_f_y interface (available since kernel 2.6.13), which provides a much superior
              interface for obtaining notifications of filesystem events.  See iinnoottiiffyy(7).

              Change the capacity of the pipe referred to by _f_d to be at least _a_r_g bytes.  An unprivileged  process  can  adjust  the  pipe
              capacity  to  any  value  between  the  system  page  size and the limit defined in _/_p_r_o_c_/_s_y_s_/_f_s_/_p_i_p_e_-_m_a_x_-_s_i_z_e (see pprroocc(5)).
              Attempts to set the pipe capacity below the page size are silently rounded up to the page size.  Attempts by an  unprivileged

              (CCAAPP__SSYYSS__RREESSOOUURRCCEE) can override the limit.  When allocating the buffer for the pipe, the kernel may  use  a  capacity  larger
              than  _a_r_g, if that is convenient for the implementation.  The actual capacity that is set is returned as the function result.
              Attempting to set the pipe capacity smaller than the amount of buffer space currently used to store data produces  the  error

       File  seals  limit the set of allowed operations on a given file.  For each seal that is set on a file, a specific set of operations
       will fail with EEPPEERRMM on this file from now on.  The file is said to be sealed.  The default set of seals depends on the type of  the
       underlying  file  and  filesystem.   For  an  overview  of  file  sealing,  a discussion of its purpose, and some code examples, see
       mmeemmffdd__ccrreeaattee(2).

       Currently, only the _t_m_p_f_s filesystem supports sealing.  On other filesystems, all ffccnnttll(2) operations that  operate  on  seals  will
       return EEIINNVVAALL.

       Seals  are  a  property of an inode.  Thus, all open file descriptors referring to the same inode share the same set of seals.  Fur‐
       thermore, seals can never be removed, only added.

       FF__AADDDD__SSEEAALLSS (_i_n_t; since Linux 3.17)
              Add the seals given in the bit-mask argument _a_r_g to the set of seals of the inode referred to  by  the  file  descriptor  _f_d.
              Seals  cannot  be  removed again.  Once this call succeeds, the seals are enforced by the kernel immediately.  If the current
              set of seals includes FF__SSEEAALL__SSEEAALL (see below), then this call will be rejected with EEPPEERRMM.  Adding a seal that is already set
              is a no-op, in case FF__SSEEAALL__SSEEAALL is not set already.  In order to place a seal, the file descriptor _f_d must be writable.

       FF__GGEETT__SSEEAALLSS (_v_o_i_d; since Linux 3.17)
              Return (as the function result) the current set of seals of the inode referred to by _f_d.  If no seals are set, 0 is returned.
              If the file does not support sealing, -1 is returned and _e_r_r_n_o is set to EEIINNVVAALL.

       The following seals are available:

       FF__SSEEAALL__SSEEAALL
              If this seal is set, any further call to ffccnnttll(2) with FF__AADDDD__SSEEAALLSS will fail with EEPPEERRMM.  Therefore, this seal  prevents  any
              modifications  to the set of seals itself.  If the initial set of seals of a file includes FF__SSEEAALL__SSEEAALL, then this effectively
              causes the set of seals to be constant and locked.

       FF__SSEEAALL__SSHHRRIINNKK
              If this seal is set, the file in question cannot be reduced in size.  This affects ooppeenn(2) with the OO__TTRRUUNNCC flag as  well  as
              ttrruunnccaattee(2)  and  ffttrruunnccaattee(2).   Those calls will fail with EEPPEERRMM if you try to shrink the file in question.  Increasing the
              file size is still possible.

       FF__SSEEAALL__GGRROOWW
              If this seal is set, the size of the file in question cannot be increased.  This affects wwrriittee(2) beyond the end of the file,
              ttrruunnccaattee(2), ffttrruunnccaattee(2), and ffaallllooccaattee(2).  These calls will fail with EEPPEERRMM if you use them to increase the file size.  If
              you keep the size or shrink it, those calls still work as expected.

       FF__SSEEAALL__WWRRIITTEE
              If this seal is set, you cannot modify the contents of the file.  Note that shrinking or growing the  size  of  the  file  is
              still  possible and allowed.  Thus, this seal is normally used in combination with one of the other seals.  This seal affects
              wwrriittee(2) and ffaallllooccaattee(2) (only in combination with the FFAALLLLOOCC__FFLL__PPUUNNCCHH__HHOOLLEE flag).  Those calls will fail with EEPPEERRMM if this
              seal is set.  Furthermore, trying to create new shared, writable memory-mappings via mmmmaapp(2) will also fail with EEPPEERRMM.

              Setting  FF__SSEEAALL__WWRRIITTEE  via  ffccnnttll(2) with FF__AADDDD__SSEEAALLSS will fail with EEBBUUSSYY if any writable, shared mapping exists.  Such map‐
              pings must be unmapped before you can add this seal.  Furthermore, if there are  any  asynchronous  I/O  operations  (iioo__ssuubb‐‐
              mmiitt(2)) pending on the file, all outstanding writes will be discarded.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEE
       For a successful call, the return value depends on the operation:

       Several systems have more fields in _s_t_r_u_c_t _f_l_o_c_k such as, for example, _l___s_y_s_i_d.  Clearly, _l___p_i_d alone is not going to be very useful
       if the process holding the lock may live on a different machine.

       The  original  Linux  ffccnnttll()  system call was not designed to handle large file offsets (in the _f_l_o_c_k structure).  Consequently, an
       ffccnnttll6644() system call was added in Linux 2.4.  The newer system call employs a different structure for file  locking,  _f_l_o_c_k_6_4,  and
       corresponding  commands,  FF__GGEETTLLKK6644,  FF__SSEETTLLKK6644, and FF__SSEETTLLKKWW6644.  However, these details can be ignored by applications using glibc,
       whose ffccnnttll() wrapper function transparently employs the more recent system call where it is available.

       Before Linux 3.12, if an NFSv4 client loses contact with the server for a period of time (defined as more than 90  seconds  with  no
       communication),  it  might  lose and regain a lock without ever being aware of the fact.  (The period of time after which contact is
       assumed lost is known as the NFSv4 leasetime.  On a Linux NFS server, this can be determined by looking at _/_p_r_o_c_/_f_s_/_n_f_s_d_/_n_f_s_v_4_l_e_a_s_e_‐
       _t_i_m_e,  which expresses the period in seconds.  The default value for this file is 90.)  This scenario potentially risks data corrup‐
       tion, since another process might acquire a lock in the intervening period and perform file I/O.

       Since Linux 3.12, if an NFSv4 client loses contact with the server, any I/O to the file by a process which "thinks" it holds a  lock
       will fail until that process closes and reopens the file.  A kernel parameter, _n_f_s_._r_e_c_o_v_e_r___l_o_s_t___l_o_c_k_s, can be set to 1 to obtain the
       pre-3.12 behavior, whereby the client will attempt to recover lost locks when contact is reestablished with the server.  Because  of
       the attendant risk of data corruption, this parameter defaults to 0 (disabled).

   FF__SSEETTFFLL
       It  is not possible to use FF__SSEETTFFLL to change the state of the OO__DDSSYYNNCC and OO__SSYYNNCC flags.  Attempts to change the state of these flags
       are silently ignored.

   FF__GGEETTOOWWNN
       A limitation of the Linux system call conventions on some architectures (notably i386) means that if a (negative) process  group  ID
       to  be returned by FF__GGEETTOOWWNN falls in the range -1 to -4095, then the return value is wrongly interpreted by glibc as an error in the
       system call; that is, the return value of ffccnnttll() will be -1, and _e_r_r_n_o will contain the (positive) process group  ID.   The  Linux-
       specific  FF__GGEETTOOWWNN__EEXX operation avoids this problem.  Since glibc version 2.11, glibc makes the kernel FF__GGEETTOOWWNN problem invisible by
       implementing FF__GGEETTOOWWNN using FF__GGEETTOOWWNN__EEXX.

   FF__SSEETTOOWWNN
       In Linux 2.4 and earlier, there is bug that can occur when an unprivileged process uses FF__SSEETTOOWWNN to specify the owner  of  a  socket
       file  descriptor as a process (group) other than the caller.  In this case, ffccnnttll() can return -1 with _e_r_r_n_o set to EEPPEERRMM, even when
       the owner process (group) is one that the caller has permission to send signals to.  Despite this error return, the file  descriptor
       owner is set, and signals will be sent to the owner.

       The deadlock-detection algorithm employed by the kernel when dealing with FF__SSEETTLLKKWW requests can yield both false negatives (failures
       to detect deadlocks, leaving a set of deadlocked processes blocked indefinitely) and false positives (EEDDEEAADDLLKK errors when  there  is
       no  deadlock).   For  example, the kernel limits the lock depth of its dependency search to 10 steps, meaning that circular deadlock
       chains that exceed that size will not be detected.  In addition, the kernel may falsely indicate a deadlock when two  or  more  pro‐
       cesses created using the cclloonnee(2) CCLLOONNEE__FFIILLEESS flag place locks that appear (to the kernel) to conflict.

       The  Linux  implementation of mandatory locking is subject to race conditions which render it unreliable: a wwrriittee(2) call that over‐
       laps with a lock may modify data after the mandatory lock is acquired; a rreeaadd(2) call that overlaps with a lock may  detect  changes
       to data that were made only after a write lock was acquired.  Similar races exist between mandatory locks and mmmmaapp(2).  It is there‐
       fore inadvisable to rely on mandatory locking.
